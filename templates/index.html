            <h2>What is Romance Fraud?</h2>
            <p>Romance fraud is an example of a consumer fraud scam. It is similar to your usual scams where the scammer will contact the victim by email, phone, social media etc. In these usual consumer fruad scams the scammer may offer you a get rich quick scheme or contact you with any scenario that warrants a response; often with the goal of scamming you financially. Romance scams differ from this as instead of offering financial motivation, such as getting rich quick, they are offering the victim something more meaningful. Romance fraud scammers are often propositioning their victims with the promise of a relationship, love and a life partner. Romance frauds impacts are much more personal than the usual consumer fraud scam as they can change the victims outlook on life, love and relationships forever. </p>
